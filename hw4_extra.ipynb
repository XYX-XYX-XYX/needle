    "For auto-regressive Transformer, this attention should support causal masking using the function `self.create_causal_mask` we have provided. This is to make sure that the prediction of next token only depends on it's previous tokens. Specifically, causal masking is applying a mask before the softmax so that the softmax probability is computed over a masked matrix of $\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{D}}$. \n",
